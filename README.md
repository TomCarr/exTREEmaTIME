# exTREEmaTIME
A method for incorporating uncertainty into divergence time estimates.\
Instructions and further details are [**here**](https://github.com/TomCarr/exTREEmaTIME/wiki/Further-details-and-instructions).

### update 24/11/21
Examples updated.

### update 15/11/21
We have become aware of one minor error in the constraints implemented in the empirical examples provided. Specifically, Amborellaceae has been missed from the angiosperm crown node maximum age constraint. This error has essentially no effect on divergence time estimates apart from the timing of the divergence between Amborella and the rest of Angiosperms. However, for clarity, updated analyses with the correct constraints will be uploaded later today.
