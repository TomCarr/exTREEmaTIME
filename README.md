# exTREEmaTIME
A method for incorporating uncertainty into divergence time estimates.\
Instructions and further details are [**here**](https://github.com/TomCarr/exTREEmaTIME/wiki/Further-details-and-instructions).

### update 15/11/21
We have become aware of two minor errors in the constraints implemented in the empirical examples provided
        1) the 132 minimum age constraint for the angiosperm crown node should be moved to the stem node
        2) Amborellaceae has been missed from the angiosperm crown node maximum age constraint
These two errors have a virtually no effect on divergence time estimates. However, for clarity, updated analyses with the correct constraints will be uploaded later today.
